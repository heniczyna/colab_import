Based on:

And the same with direct opening in Google Colab 

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

Perhaps, authorization for Google Colab needs to be given by Github. You can change this later in *Settings -> Applications -> Authorized OAuth Apps*. For example you can revoke this authorization and Colab will no longer be able to access your GitHub account.

Testing my repo:
