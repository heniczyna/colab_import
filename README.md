Based on:

And the same with direct opening in Google Colab

Perhaps, authorization for Google Colab needs to be given by Github. You can change this later in *Settings -> Applications -> Authorized OAuth Apps*. For example you can revoke this authorization and Colab will no longer be able to access your GitHub account.

Testing my repo (repo created in Colab, then saved to local drive as .ipynb [*File -> Download .ipynb*], then uploaded to Github):
