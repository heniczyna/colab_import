# *Testing the integration of Github and Google Colab*

Based on this [guide](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)<br/>
And the same with direct opening in Google Colab

Testing my repo (repo created in Colab, then saved to local drive as .ipynb [*File -> Download .ipynb*], then uploaded to Github):

> * **Note!** To make changes in notebook opened in Colab, you need to save your own copy in your Google Drive (anyway, if you just try to Save changes, Colab will pop up that you need to create a copy firstly).
> * **Note!** Perhaps, authorization for Google Colab needs to be given by Github. You can change this later in your Github account *Settings -> Applications -> Authorized OAuth Apps*. For example you can revoke this authorization and Colab will no longer be able to access your GitHub account.
