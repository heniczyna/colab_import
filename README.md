Based on:

And the same with direct opening in Google Colab (your Github account needs to give authorization to Google Colab to open notebooks directly; for details go to *Settings -> Applications -> Authorized OAuth Apps*).

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

Testing my repo:

Colaboratory will no longer be able to access your GitHub account. You cannot undo this action.
